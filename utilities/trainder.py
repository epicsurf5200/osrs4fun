# Step 1: Prepare your dataset

# Step 2: Preprocess the images

# Step 3: Design your DNN architecture

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    # Add layers to your model
])

# Step 4: Initialize the model

# Step 5: Define the loss function

# Step 6: Choose an optimizer

# Step 7: Train the model

# Step 8: Evaluate the model

# Step 9: Fine-tune the model

# Save the trained model
